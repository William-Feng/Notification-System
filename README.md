# Notification-System

This is the file from my one week work experience at CSIRO Data61 from 08/11/2019 to 12/11/2019.

The purpose was to create a notification system for employees. 
This code operates a series of products connected to the Arduino board:
- Swings a bell attached to the servomotor once a day to signal that it's time for the daily standup
- Plays 'Ode to Joy' via a buzzer to remind employees to take a stretch (quick break)
- Displays the time since the previous standup using a LCD screen
- Displays a warming message on the LCD screen whenever a button was pressed
